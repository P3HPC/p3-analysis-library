Simple Navigation Chart
=======================

A simple navigation chart.

The point in the top-right corner represents the ideal, where an application
achieves the best performance across all platforms of interest using a single
source code.

The point in the top-left corner represents applications that achieve the best
performance across all platforms of interest, but do so without reusing any
code.

Any point along the x-axis represents an application which is unportable (i.e.
there is at least one platform of interest where it does not run).

Real-life applications are expected to lie somewhere between these extremes.

A navigation chart is a useful way to visualize the trade-offs between
performance (portability) and programmer productivity, assisting in navigation
of the P3 space and reasoning about how to reach development goals.
