        "\n\n# Working with Application Efficiency\n\nUnderstanding relative performance.\n\nOne goal of P3 analysis is to understand how well a given application is able\nto adapt to and make effective use of the capabilities of different\nplatforms. Comparisons of *raw* performance (e.g., time to solution) across\nplatforms can't help us, because raw performance doesn't reflect how fast an\napplication **should** run.\n\nTo address this, the P3 Analysis Library works with normalized *performance\nefficiency* data. With normalized data, an application's performance can be\nrepresented as a number in the range $[0, 1]$, where $1$ means\nan application is achieving the best possible performance.\n\nThere are multiple ways we can normalize the data to measure relative\nefficiency, and for this tutorial we will consider *application efficiency*,\ndefined below:\n\n**Application Efficiency**\n  The performance of an *application*, measured relative to the best known\n  performance previously demonstrated for solving the same *problem* on the\n  same *platform*.\n\nWorking with application efficiency is simple because it does not rely on\nperformance models or theoretical hardware limits. Although it can't tell us\nwhether an application is performing as well as theoretically possible, it\nshows how an application compares to the state-of-the-art, which is often good\nenough.\n\n## Calculating Application Efficiency\n\nLet's begin with a very simple example, with a single application, using the\ndata below:\n\n.. list-table::\n    :widths: 20 20 20 20 20\n    :header-rows: 1\n\n    * - problem\n      - application\n      - platform\n      - fom\n      - date\n\n    * - Test\n      - MyApp\n      - A\n      - 25.0\n      - 2023\n    * - Test\n      - MyApp\n      - B\n      - 12.5\n      - 2023\n    * - Test\n      - MyApp\n      - C\n      - 25.0\n      - 2023\n    * - Test\n      - MyApp\n      - D\n      - NaN\n      - 2023\n    * - Test\n      - MyApp\n      - E\n      - 5.0\n      - 2023\n\n.. tip::\n    A NaN or 0.0 performance result is interpreted by the P3 Analysis Library\n    to mean that an application run was in some way invalid. We can use this\n    to explicitly represent cases where applications did not compile on\n    specific platforms, did not run to completion, or ran but produced\n    numerical results that failed some sort of verification.\n"

        "These initial results may be a little surprising, because they're all\neither 1.0 or 0.0. What happened? Since our dataset contains only one result\nfor MyApp on each platform, each non-zero result is the \"best known\" result\nfor that platform! The only exception is Platform D, which is assigned an\nefficiency of 0.0 to reflect that it either did not compile, or did not run\nsuccessfully.\n\n.. tip::\n    Calculating meaningful application efficiency results requires a minimum\n    of two results *per platform*.\n\n### Digging Deeper: Adding More Data\n\nLet's see what happens if we add some more data, from a different application\nrunning on the same platforms:\n\n.. list-table::\n    :widths: 20 20 20 20 20\n    :header-rows: 1\n\n    * - problem\n      - application\n      - platform\n      - fom\n      - date\n\n    * - Test\n      - YourApp\n      - A\n      - 25.0\n      - 2023\n    * - Test\n      - YourApp\n      - B\n      - 10.0\n      - 2023\n    * - Test\n      - YourApp\n      - C\n      - 12.5\n      - 2023\n    * - Test\n      - YourApp\n      - D\n      - 6.0\n      - 2023\n    * - Test\n      - YourApp\n      - E\n      - 1.0\n      - 2023\n\n"

However, it is straightforward to use\n:py:mod:`matplotlib` and/or the plotting functionality of :py:mod:`pandas` to\nproduce useful visualizations.\n\nFor example, plotting a bar chart of application efficiences for one\napplication can help us to summarize that application's performance more\neffectively than a table:\n\n"
